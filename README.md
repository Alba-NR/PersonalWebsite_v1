### :pushpin: Note:
The aim of this website is to serve as a personal portfolio/résumé. I decided to start developing it as a small project in which I could learn HTML and CSS and then put these skills into practice. I also took the opportunity to consider the UI and UX design aspects of it, to make a better overall experience. This repository is set to public to showcase this project; however, this doesn't mean the code can be freely copied and used, please see the [Copyright Notice](#grey_exclamation-copyright-notice) below.
